# Versions

mathBasher uses **sprint id as version**: every closed sprint produces a release whose version equals its sprint id.

| Sprint | npm version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1` | `0.1.0` | Foundation scaffold |
| `0.2` | `0.2.0` | Math engine |
| ... | ... | ... |
| `0.7` | `0.7.0` | Foundation complete = MVP candidate |
| (cut MVP) | `1.0.0` | First publicly-tagged release after 0.7 closes (optional ceremonial bump) |
| `1.1` | `1.1.0` | First Phase 1 sprint (e.g. Add to 20) |
| `1.2` | `1.2.0` | ... |

Patch level (third digit) is reserved for hotfixes within a closed sprint. For example, a CSS regression fix shipping after `0.4.0` closes but before `0.5.0` opens is `0.4.1`.

## Conventions

- `package.json#version` is bumped to match the sprint id when a sprint Closes
- A new entry is prepended to the changelog below in the same commit
- Both updates land as part of the sprint-close workflow (not the human's job to remember by hand)
- Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) loosely — categories used as needed

## Changelog

<!-- New entries go ABOVE this comment, newest first. -->

## [Unreleased]

- Sprint 0.1 in planning. Will scaffold Vite + TypeScript + Phaser 3, the folder layout, central config, telemetry stub, Express server with `/health`, Azure-ready Dockerfile, SPDX headers on all source files, and the attribution constants module.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-05-08 — Project skeleton

Initial planning and setup phase. No application code yet; this version establishes the project's legal, architectural, and process foundations.

### Added
- AGPL-3.0-or-later + Commercial dual license (`LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `COMMERCIAL.md`)
- AGPL §7(b) UI attribution requirement, with architectural enforcement plan via a persistent `AttributionScene` (to be implemented in sprint 0.4)
- Project `README.md` and `VERSIONS.md`
- Third-party asset credits skeleton at `public/assets/CREDITS.md`
- Seven public Architecture Decision Records under `docs/adrs/`:
  - ADR-0001 Tech stack — Vite + TypeScript + Phaser 3
  - ADR-0002 Single-container deployment with Express server
  - ADR-0003 Single central config file for all gameplay tuning
  - ADR-0004 Dual license (AGPL + Commercial) with §7(b) UI attribution
  - ADR-0005 Sprint id is the release version
  - ADR-0006 Folder discipline (no Phaser in /math or /services)
  - ADR-0007 Azure App Service for Containers (over Container Apps)
- Repo hygiene: `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (LF normalization, binary marks), `.editorconfig`
- Initial directory structure for `public/assets/`
